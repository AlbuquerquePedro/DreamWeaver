DreamWeaver is a Flask-based web server designed to manage and analyze dreams. It uses Flask for server management and SQLAlchemy for database interactions, specifically connecting to a PostgreSQL database. The project integrates middleware for efficient JSON parsing, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server. DreamWeaver features dedicated routes for managing dreams and their subsequent analyses. It is configured to listen on port 5000, providing a standard access point for web-based interactions.
